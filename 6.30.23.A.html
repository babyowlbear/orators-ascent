Frangitorbis: Orator&#39;s Ascent is a choose your own adventure game set in the world of Frangitorbis, where the Perennials who created the world now walk it, and where only a select few can tap into the magical force of the Dialect.
***
&gt;In this story your choices will effect the world around you, starting with the town in which you are born, and eventually spreading to the entire kingdom and beyond. However, your choices are limited by your statistics. Several forms of statistics exist, and they are all explained below.
***
&gt;Attributes define your general capabilities. The attributes you can develop are Athleticism, Awareness, Intellect, and Sway. Athleticism covers physical acts, from captivating feats of strength to astounding shows of acrobatics. Awareness is your capability to take in the world around you, from noticing hidden cabinets to catching someone in a lie. Intellect covers your knowledge, from knowledge of history to the ability to solve a puzzle. Lastly, Sway cover your general charisma, ranging from the ability to hide the truth to your ability to convince other of your ideals.
***
&gt; Energy is an unique statistic that you use for manipulation the Dialect. This is the form of magic that exists in Frangitorbis. Energy burns away when using magical abilities, and is incredibly difficult to get back. You start with 100, and the more powerful an ability the more Energy it costs. Reaching zero Energy is lethal.
***
&gt;Lastly, Skills are specific unlockable statistics that can allow you to access different options. These range from the ability to pick locks to a status or job. These are fairly rare to get, and are extremely valuable when found.
***
&gt;Every option in the game will say what statistics it effects, as well as if it is only present because of a specific statistic. Now, with the basic of gameplay explained, let&#39;s begin with the basics.

You stand in darkness. No, stand doesn&#39;t quite cover it. You are there, floating in nothing, no body, not that you would know what a body is. You haven&#39;t even been born yet. And so you wait for some guidance, and in short fashion it does arrive. A figure wearing grey robes steps into your view, its hood covering any hints of distiguising characteristics. In time you would learn this entity to be called the Grey Shepherd, but for now it was simply all there was.
***
The entity raised its Crook, gesturing to the distance. An opening appeared, the first light to exist in this place outside of any place. Through it you could see the faint sillouettes of two figures. The Shephard gestures you forth. You can feel a sense of warmth and compassion from this cloaked figure, a genuine level of care for your well being. As you floated through the opening, you felt air sting your skin for the first time.

&gt; [[Cry]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Cry" tags="" position="800,575" size="100,100">As your wails trumpet your arrival, you see the people surrounding you. A bearded man sits at the end of your bed adorned in the garbs of a lowly manual laborer. He excudes an energy of determination, his jaw set firmly even as he looks at you with pride in his eyes. 
***
&quot;{Pronoun} {Has} arrived&quot; the midwife said with a chuckle. She had a kind face, with clean, comfortable garbs. Her amulet made it clear she worshipped the Perennials, a beautiful crystal butterfly symbolizing the Lady of the Chrysalis. A Harbringer, you would learn these worshippers to be called.
***
Turning your head, you see your mother, a woman of graceful complexion. Even now, with sweat covering her face, a level of joy and light radiated from her. She looked at you with a jovial smile on her face.
***
And yet still, you found yourself remembering the warmth and compassion you felt from the robed entity. Surely that connection could remain just a moment longer.

You reach out for your father. A look of surprise goes over his face, but he quickly recovers and scoops you up. You settle into his strong arms, his calloused hands holding you tight. It&#39;s clear in his face that he is unsure what to do with you, but the pride in his eyes stay even in his uncertainty.
***
&quot;Welcome to the world, {Name}. I know you&#39;ll make me proud.&quot; He chuckles, looking to your mother. &quot;Somehow {Pronoun} already {Has}.&quot;

You reach out for the Harbringer, her kind face beckoning for you. &quot;Oh, hello little one.&quot; She looks between your parents as she picks you up. &quot;Don&#39;t be offended, children are often drawn to the Lady of the Chrysalis&#39; grace.&quot; She looks down at you now, her holy symbol glinting in the light. &quot;Isn&#39;t that right little {Name}? Her blessing upon you.&quot;

You turn around, reaching for your mother. She takes you in her arms, smiling down at your small form. &quot;{Pronoun} really {Is} wonderful.&quot; Her joy is evident on her face, and even as you age and your young memories fade you will always cherish the joy and hope she puts into the world. &quot;My little {Name}&quot;

You close your eyes, focusing on the fading warmth of the Shepherd. You see the entity in your mind as it turns towards you. The voice that emerges is warm and compassionate. The voice doesn&#39;t seem indicative of a sex or gender, even if you did have a concept of that structure at this time.
***
&quot;This isn&#39;t the place for you young {Title} {LastName}. You will see me again one day. For now, {Name}, you have to do me a favor.&quot; The entity leans close, yet still its face remains out of sight. &quot;Live.&quot;
***
Your mother holds you, concern in her eyes. &quot;{Pronoun} {Is} waking up!&quot; The Harbringer sighs. &quot;It is not uncommon for a child to struggle through the threshold. It should not affect {Pronoun2} further.&quot;
