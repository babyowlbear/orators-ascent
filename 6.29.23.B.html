You stand in darkness. No, stand doesn&#39;t quite cover it. You are there, floating in nothing, no body, not that you would know what a body is. You haven&#39;t even been born yet. And so you wait for some guidance, and in short fashion it does arrive. A figure wearing grey robes steps into your view, their hood covering any hints of distiguising characteristics. In time you would learn this entity to be called the Grey Shepherd, but for now it was simply all there was.
***
The entity raised his Crook, gesturing to the distance. An opening appeared, the first light to exist in this place outside of any place. Through it you could see the faint sillouettes of two figures. The Shephard gestures you forth. You can feel a sense of warmth and compassion from this cloaked figure, a genuine level of care for your well being. As you floated through the opening, you felt air sting your skin for the first time.

A bearded man sits at the end of your bed adorned in the garbs of a lowly manual laborer. He excudes an energy of determination, his jaw set firmly even as he looks at you with pride in his eyes.

&quot;{Pronoun} {Has} arrived&quot; the midwife said with a chuckle. She had a kind face, with clean, comfortable garbs.Her amulet made it clear she worshipped the Perennials. A Harbringer, you would learn these worshippers to be called.
***
Turning your head, you see your mother, a woman of graceful complexion. Even now, with sweat covering her face, a level of joy and light radiated from her. She looked at you with a jovial smile on her face.
***
And yet still, you found yourself remembering the warmth and compassion you felt from the robed entity. Surely that connection could remain just a moment longer.
